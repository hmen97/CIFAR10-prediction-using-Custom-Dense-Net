# CIFAR10-prediction-using-Custom-Dense-Net
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. 

I used Google colabs to train this model so I did it in two steps as colabs dosen't run for more than 8 hours at a time.
I saved the model, loaded it and then retrained it to achieve a 90.09 accuracy with just around 850 thousand parameters. 
You can change the number of layers and growth rate to get more trainable parameters to improve the accuracy of the model.
